# Clickstream-data-analysis

We herein explored clickstream data of Wikipedia, the largest go-to reference website, for potential business values from the data. The analysis we provided here could be easily customized to provide real-world business impacts.

● Topic recommendation

Based on clickstream data analysis and market basket analysis, we built a topic recommendation system, in which recommendations were ranked according to the weighted connection with topics, and recommendation results could be more customized based on user’s browsing history

● Topic classification

This project offered a solution for topic classification based on web traffic data analysis, where movie names and movie star topics were separated with more than 85% confidence. This is specifically useful when classification is the business concern, such as fraud alert, virus detection and spam detection 

● Profits prediction

   Nowadays, profits obtained from ad clicks are the major source of profits for internet companies. The algorithm we developed here will 1) identify the most profitable articles for our ads based on NLP and 2) predict the profits for specific ad based on clickstream data.
