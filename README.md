1. Topic recommendation
   Based on clickstream data analysis, we built a topic recommendation system, in which recommendations were ranked according to the weighted connection with topics

2. Topic classification
   This offered a solution for topic classification based on clickstream data analysis, where movie names and movie star topics were separated with more than 85% confidence. This is specifically useful when classification is the primary business concern, such as fraud alert, virus detection and spam detection.
